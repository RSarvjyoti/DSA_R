#### Problems 
1. Balance Parantheses
2. Stock span problem
3. Nearest immidiate smaller element to its left (NSE left)
  - example i/p => {7,2,4,6,9,3,8,11}, o/p => {-1,-1,2,4,6,2,3,8}
4. Nearest immidiate smaller element to its right (NSE right)
  - example i/p => {7,2,4,6,9,3,8,11}, o/p => {2,-1,3,3,3,-1,-1,-1}
5. Nearest immidiate greater element to its left (NGE left)
  - example i/p => {7,2,4,6,9,3,8,11}, o/p => {-1,7,7,7,-1,9,9,-1}
6. Nearest immidiate greater element to its right (NGE right)
  - example i/p => {7,2,4,6,9,3,8,11}, o/p => {9,4,6,9,11,8,11,-1}
7. Vailid stack
  - i/n -> a1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}, a2 = {4,5,3,2,1}, o/p -> true
  - i/n -> a1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}, a2 = {4,5,3,1,2}, o/p -> false
